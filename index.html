                  <div class="cont-sec-l">
                    <p>Nexxus Energy are also highly committed to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) (2017) along with
                      many of the leading oil and gas companies on the Climate A List. We welcome the opportunity to
                      work alongside industry partners across various disciplines in a move towards the decarbonisation
                      of the world energy system.</p>
                    <p>Nexxus Energy was formerly known as Endeavour Energy Partners during the period of time the
                      company was initially financially underpinned by private equity business - Endeavour Capital of
                      New Zealand. When the opportunity arose for the majority shareholder (UFG) to undertake a stock
                      repurchase of Endeavour Capital's minority shareholding, UFG moved to increase their shareholding
                      to 100% outright ownership of the company.</p>

                        Nexxus Energy’s rise to becoming an active player within the market has been a formidable, yet
                        rewarding adventure. We are the first to identify that this sector can be challenging and
                        definitely not without its risks. Over and above delivering our financial targets, our
                        shareholders are committed to the future and we have agreed a strategy to re-invest a portion of
                        our profits into new low carbon start-up companies. This will be achieved through collaboration
                        with Business Accelerators, Incubators and Academia. What’s encouraging is that this strategy
                        has piqued the interest of some of our counterparts within this sector who are equally
                        determined to build a sustainable future for the next generations; namely, a low carbon economy.

                        Nexxus Energy operate their business using a very simple approach: All trading counterparties
                        will
                        be asked to submit initial KYC/CIS documentation, which will be checked by our inhouse
                        compliance
                        team and later shared with our banking partners. Counterparties may be asked to show financial
                        capability and suppliers may be asked to show proof of past performance. This will be on a
                        transaction-by-transaction basis and will be dependent on our compliance teams’ findings once
                        due
